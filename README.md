# Note

I've excluded some things from the code due to privacy and security purposes
you've to make a new project in firebase console and add these things on your own,
if you plan to clone the repository because it won't work out of the box.
* google-services.json
* A string resource for the API key.
* Build the project and copy sha-1 hash for both debug and release built
* paste it in firebase console for authentication to work.
